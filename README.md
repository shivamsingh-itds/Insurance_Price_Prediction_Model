# Insurance Price Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using regression techniques. It covers the complete data science workflow including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building to understand how different factors influence insurance pricing.

The project is part of a **15 Days – 15 Projects** learning challenge, aimed at building strong practical foundations in data analysis and machine learning.

## Problem Statement

Medical insurance charges vary significantly based on personal and lifestyle factors.  
The objective of this project is to analyze these factors and build regression models that can predict insurance charges accurately.
