# Insurance Price Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using regression techniques. It covers the complete data science workflow including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building to understand how different factors influence insurance pricing.

The project is part of a **15 Days – 15 Projects** learning challenge, aimed at building strong practical foundations in data analysis and machine learning.

## Problem Statement

Medical insurance charges vary significantly based on personal and lifestyle factors.  
The objective of this project is to analyze these factors and build regression models that can predict insurance charges accurately.

---

## Dataset

- Source: Insurance dataset (commonly used for regression practice)
- Target variable: `charges`
- Features include:
  - age
  - sex
  - bmi
  - children
  - smoker
  - region

The dataset is stored locally inside the `data/` directory.

## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distribution
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Identifying patterns and relationships
   - Correlation analysis

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Creating meaningful derived features
   - Preparing data for regression models

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Tree-based regression models
   - Model comparison using evaluation metrics

4. **Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
